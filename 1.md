#### Main CircleCI strength

**Simple UI.** CircleCI is recognized for its user-friendly interface for managing builds/jobs. Its single-page web app is clean and easy to understand
**High-quality customer support.** StackShare’s community members highlight CircleCI’s speedy support: They respond to requests within 12 hours.
CircleCI runs **all types of software tests** including web, mobile, and container environments.
**Caching of requirements installation and third-party dependencies.** Instead of installing the environments, CircleCI can take data from multiple projects using the granular check-out-key options.
**No need for manual debugging.** CircleCI has debugging feature Debug via SSH, but Jenkins users have to debug manually by clicking on jobs.
