## Pros and Cons

#### Main CircleCI strength

**Simple UI.** CircleCI is recognized for its user-friendly interface for managing builds/jobs. Its single-page web app is clean and easy to understand
**High-quality customer support.** StackShare’s community members highlight CircleCI’s speedy support: They respond to requests within 12 hours.
CircleCI runs **all types of software tests** including web, mobile, and container environments.
**Caching of requirements installation and third-party dependencies.** Instead of installing the environments, CircleCI can take data from multiple projects using the granular check-out-key options.
**No need for manual debugging.** CircleCI has debugging feature Debug via SSH, but Jenkins users have to debug manually by clicking on jobs.

## Executors and Images

#### Overview

CircleCI enables you to run jobs in one of three environments:

* Within Docker images (docker)
* Within a Linux virtual machine (VM) image (machine)
* Within a macOS VM image (macos)

It is possible to specify a different executor type for every job in your `.circleci/config.yml` by specifying the 
executor type and an appropriate image.
Main differences between using Docker and VM:

| Virtual Environment                        | Docker  | Machine   |
|--------------------------------------------|---------|-----------|
| Start time                                 | Instant | 30-60 sec |
| Clean environment                          | Yes     | Yes       |
| Custom images                              | Yes     | No        |
| Build Docker images                        | Yes     | Yes       |
| Full control over job environment          | No      | Yes       |
| Full root access                           | No      | Yes       |
| Run multiple databases                     | Yes     | Yes       |
| Run multiple versions of the same software | No      | Yes       |
| Layer caching                              | Yes     | Yes       |
| Run privileged containers                  | No      | Yes       |
| Use docker compose with volumes            | No      | Yes       |
| Configurable resources (CPU/RAM)           | Yes     | No        |

The docker key defines Docker as the underlying technology to run your jobs using Docker Containers. 
Containers are an instance of the Docker Image you specify. The first image listed in your configuration is 
the primary container image in which all steps run. All other containers run in a common network and every exposed 
port will be available on localhost from a primary container.

#### Pre-Built CircleCI Docker Images

For convenience, CircleCI maintains several Docker images. These images are typically extensions of official Docker 
images and include tools especially useful for CI/CD. All of these pre-built images are available in the [CircleCI org
on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=circleci&type=image). 

CircleCI’s convenience images fall into two categories: **language images** and **service images**. 
All images add a circleci user as a system user.

#### Language Images

Language images are convenience images for common programming languages. These images include both the relevant 
language and commonly-used tools. A language image should be listed first under the docker key in your configuration, 
making it the primary container during execution.

CircleCI maintains images for the languages below.

* Android
* Clojure
* Elixir
* Go (Golang)
* JRuby
* Node.js
* OpenJDK (Java)
* PHP
* Python
* Ruby
* Rust

#### Language Image Variants

CircleCI maintains several variants for language images. To use these variants, add one of the following suffixes 
to the end of an image tag.

* `-node` includes Node.js for polyglot applications
* `-browsers` includes Chrome, Firefox, Java 8, and Geckodriver
* `-browsers-legacy` includes Chrome, Firefox, Java 8, and PhantomJS
* `-node-browsers` combines the -node and -browsers variants
* `-node-browsers-legacy` combines the -node and -browsers-legacy variants

#### Service Images

Service images are convenience images for services like databases. These images should be listed after language images 
so they become secondary service containers.

CircleCI maintains images for the services below.

* buildpack-deps
* DynamoDB
* MariaDB
* MongoDB
* MySQL
* PostgreSQL
* Redis

#### Sample Configuration

```yaml
version: 2
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/ruby:2.5.1-node
      - image: circleci/postgres:9.6
      - image: redis
```

## Jobs, Steps and Workflows
#### Jobs

Jobs are a collection of Steps. All of the steps in the job are executed in a single unit which consumes a CircleCI 
container from your plan while it’s running.

Jobs and Steps enable greater control and provide a framework for workflows and status on each phase of a run to 
report more frequent feedback. The following diagram illustrates how data flows between jobs. Workspaces persist 
data between jobs in a single Workflow. Caching persists data between the same job in different Workflow builds. 
Artifacts persist data after a Workflow has finished.

#### Steps

Steps are a collection of executable commands which are run during a job, the `checkout:` key is required to checkout 
your code and a key for `run:` enables addition of arbitrary, multi-line shell command scripting. In addition 
to the `run:` key, keys for `save_cache:`, `restore_cache:`, `deploy:`, `store_artifacts:`, `store_test_results:` and 
`add_ssh_keys` are nested under Steps.

```yaml
version: 2
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/<language>:<version TAG>
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: <command>
  test:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/<language>:<version TAG>
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: <command>
workflows:
  version: 2
  build_and_test:
    jobs:
      - build
      - test
```
