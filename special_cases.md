## 5. Lintering

There is an opportunity to control the quality of your code with a help of CircleCI using linters. You can configure CircleCI with one or several types of lintering:

- ### with linter aggregator ([overcommit](https://github.com/sds/overcommit), inquisition, etc.)

  This approach might be interesting for those who starts new project or who have small project, because enabling linters with this aggregators might return you to much issues and errors, so it will be hard to maintain all this staff.

- ### with aggregator for Github mentions ([pronto](https://github.com/prontolabs/pronto))

  It can be useful to choose pronto when you have old huge project, because pronto can lint newly added code ignoring old one. Thus you can handle such project lintering with pronto.

- ### with run of each linter

  You can also run each linter individually. It may be done with simple `run` step, for example:
  ```
  - run:
      name: Run rubocop
      command: bundle exec rubocop
  ```

  While it is simple to use each linter one by one, there are some drawbacks. At-first, you can't manage linters output on CI. At-second, some linters doesn't raise an exception, so step can be marked as 'success'. At-third, you can't manage which code to lint, the linter will proceed all project.

  But you can place `.sh` files with some script in `bin` directory, and then execute latter during CI build running:
  ```
  - run: bash bin/rubocop.sh
  ```

  `rubocop.sh` file example:
  #### Collect differences between your brach and base branch
  ```
  #!/usr/bin/env bash

  BASE_REMOTE=origin
  BASE_BRANCH=develop

  git fetch $BASE_REMOTE $BASE_BRANCH

  differences_list=()
  commit_list=`git --no-pager log --no-merges $BASE_REMOTE/$BASE_BRANCH...$CIRCLE_BRANCH | grep -e '^commit' | sed -e "s/^commit \(.\{8\}\).*/\1/"`
  changed_files_list = `git --no-pager diff $BASE_REMOTE/$BASE_BRANCH...$CIRCLE_BRANCH --name-only`

  for file in $changed_files_list; do
    for commit in $commit_list; do
      differences=`git --no-pager blame --follow --show-name -s $file | grep $commit | sed -e "s/^[^ ]* *\([^ ]*\) *\([0-9]*\)*).*$/\1:\2/"`
      for line in $differences; do
        differences_list+=("$line")
      done
    done
  done
  ```
  #### Collect errors
  ```
  error_counts=0
  error_lines=()

  while read line; do
    for difference in ${differences_list[@]}; do
      if [[ "$line" =~ "$difference" ]]; then
        error_counts=$(($error_counts + 1))
        error_lines+=("$line")
        break
      fi
    done
  done < <(bundle exec rubocop --format emacs)
  ```
  #### Exit with error message if error counts greater then zero
  ```
  if [ $error_counts -ne 0 ]; then
    echo -e "\033[31m$error_counts Lint Errors\033[0;39m"
    echo -e "\033[31m-----------------------------------\033[0;39m\n"
    printf '\033[31m%s\n' "${error_lines[@]}"
    echo -e "\033[31mPlease resolve them before merging.\033[0;39m"
    exit 1
  fi
  ```
